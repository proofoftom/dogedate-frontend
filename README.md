# DogeDate Frontend

![Main](dogedate.png)

## What is this?

A CryptoKitties knock off with Doges. An additional feature on top of siring will be the aspect of a DogeShow, where users compete by entering their Doge and then, utilizing Loom side chains, perform actions to gain an advantage over the other competitors and knock them out of the competition, all the while building a pool for the winner. Participating in a DogeShow also entitles the user to an ERC721 raffle ticket, which can be purchased if not participating. At the end of a DogeShow, a portion of the pool will go to the raffle winner and the rest will go to the winning pup. A user could also, utilizing Loom side chains, have smaller maintenance tasks that they have to perform (i.e. feed daily, play fetch, etc.) to maintain a Doge's happiness to be able to perform in a DogeShow.
